Protocol for Usability tests for Grocery pals

Introduction:
Thank you for being a participant in testing our new mobile application. This usability test should not take no longer than 45 minutes. This test is to gain insight on how you would use this application and how we can improve the product in future iterations. Keep in mind though, that this is not a test of you, we are evaluating the website.  

While you use the mobile application, we would like you to “think aloud” and give us details on what you are thinking as you try and accomplish the task. We would also like to know your dislikes and likes, and what surprises you and confuses you, during the testing procedure. 


Background:

Name of application: 
Features:



What features would you like in a mobile shopping application? 



Task:
Imagine it is a friday, and you got out of class. To celebrate the weekend, you want to pick up a 12-pack of corona beer. You want to find the closest store to your location that sells them.



    Did the user find a store that was close by?
    Did the user complete the task?

On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult”and 5 is “Very Easy”how would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task?Why?
