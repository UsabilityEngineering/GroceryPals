**Explanation of protocol tasks:**

Protocol tasks

The goal of the protocol tasks is to see if the user is able to navigate to a store location with the appropriate item.

The first task is to find the users favorite beer, which is Corona Extra, this is a simple task deisnged to see if the user is able to 
naviage the app in an effiecent and effective way.

The second task is to see how effective the list feature is to the user and to test how mutiple items effect the outcome of the task.



**Overall Approach to Study:**

Our Protoype has an overall Formative approach with the possibility of a "think aloud" protocol. The Formative Approach is clearly evident and relevant for this type of protocol, because it is strictly used for improvement of the interface and design. This approach allows the subject and/or user to give direct feedback on how the design works in order to gauge potential improvements. Meanwhile, having a "think aloud" protocol would also be extremely beneficial. This allows us to gain insight into the user we otherwise would be unable to.
