**Overall Approach to Study:**

Our Protoype has an overall Formative approach with the possibility of a "think aloud" protocol. The Formative Approach is clearly evident and relevant for this type of protocol, because it is strictly used for improvement of the interface and design. This approach allows the subject and/or user to give direct feedback on how the design works in order to gauge potential improvements. Meanwhile, having a "think aloud" protocol would also be extremely beneficial. This allows us to gain insight into the user we otherwise would be unable to.
