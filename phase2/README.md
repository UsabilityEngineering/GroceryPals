These are our wireframe Artboards:

These Artboards are centered around the feedback we recieved on our user inquiry. They are based around the overwhelmingly strong user feedback that shows that people want to find a better deal on groceries. This was our plan from the begining, however, the feedback we recieved proposed a change. There were a few people that said in their feedback that they like some stores specifically for their specialised products. These include possibly specific store brands, or items from specialty stores such as Trader Joes and Whole foods. The design is centered around the concept that users will shop at stores mostly because of their relative location, so upon app startup, we give users a map of all the nearst grocery stores. On the top bar in the app, users can select either "SHOP", "LIST", or "SEARCH". SHOP allows users to see a list of nearby stores, and searching within that store's inventory. Perfect for specialty items, or finding an item that you know you saw at a specific store. LIST, help's users mange their grocery list. It shows their current grocery list, with an add item button, which allows you to search for and add more items. There is a "checkout" section as well, that calculates the cost of the given grocery list accross all the stores in the user's defined distance radius, and then they can sort their results by either distance or price. SEARCH allows users to directly search for items without having to go into their list first. These are all modeled after our data and personas, which are mostly college students who want to find the cheapest place to buy their groceries.
