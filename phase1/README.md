# Team Name, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

**Google Survey**

* We Used this method as it made the most sense. Because it deals with cost and user preference instead of imprving an existing expierience, this made the most sense for our project, as we can design and shape or concept based upon user responses.

* The number of responses gathered, n = 20

## Findings

**Google Survey**

* Demographics (Age)

The demographics for our survey was incredibly diverse, which is amazing. The age of our responders ranged from 21 all the way to 79 years old. This, while a large portion is closer to the younger side, accurately represents our user base. This is because while our proposed app can be utilized by anyone, a large portion of the base will be a younger audience, as the older generation simply has less interest in new technology. However, some do, and that as a percentage of our users is accurately represented.

* How often do you go grocery shopping?

Responses to this question was approximately a 50/50 split between "once a month" and "multiple times a week." This distribution is important, as our users are shopping on a regular basis, thus proving that an app as proposed will save a lot of money over time. 

* Would comparing the prices of different grocery stores be beneficial?

## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

## Caveats

Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do
