# Team Name, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

**Google Survey**

* We Used this method as it made the most sense. Because it deals with cost and user preference instead of imprving an existing expierience, this made the most sense for our project, as we can design and shape or concept based upon user responses.

* The number of responses gathered, n = 20

## Findings

For each method, describe the users you collected data from (demographics and how they represent your user base) and summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you may want to include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

## Caveats

Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do
