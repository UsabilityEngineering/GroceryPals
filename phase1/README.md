# Grocery Pals, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

**Google Survey**

* We Used this method as it made the most sense. Because it deals with cost and user preference instead of imprving an existing expierience, this made the most sense for our project, as we can design and shape or concept based upon user responses.

* The number of responses gathered, n = 20

## Findings

**Google Survey**

* Demographics (Age)

The demographics for our survey was incredibly diverse, which is amazing. The age of our responders ranged from 21 all the way to 79 years old. This, while a large portion is closer to the younger side, accurately represents our user base. This is because while our proposed app can be utilized by anyone, a large portion of the base will be a younger audience, as the older generation simply has less interest in new technology. However, some do, and that as a percentage of our users is accurately represented.

* How often do you go grocery shopping?

Responses to this question was approximately a 50/50 split between "once a month" and "multiple times a week." This distribution is important, as our users are shopping on a regular basis, thus proving that an app as proposed will save a lot of money over time. 

* Would comparing the prices of different grocery stores be beneficial?

The response to this question is the most critical, as it outlines whether or not our concept will be actually useful and used. Thankfully, we were presented with overwhelming "yes" responses, with the exception of three "maybe" responses. This provides significant feedback that our concept will actually be useful.

* Do you often encounter items at the grocery store that are far more expensive than you initially thought?

The response to this question was mixed, evenly distributed across all responses. This truly proves hoow unpredictable grocery shopping can be. 

* Do you use any form of app or online method of making grocery lists? If so, what do you use?

This question had a semi-decent response rate, and gave a feel for what the "competition" looks like. Overall, responses given vary, nd people use apps that are not entirely made for the express purpose of grocery lists, which gives feedback on the barrier of entry into the market.

* Do you find that stores do not have the item you are looking for in stock?

The Strong "yes" response in this question proposes the idea that an "inventory" section of our app miht be helpful and utilized. 

* What factors determine where you do your grocery shopping?

The responses here largely were largely evenly distributed. This shows that many different people and types of people go shopping for different reasons, and chose their store based upon both location, as well as either sales or specialty stock, usually not both. Incorporating both separately into the application will be helpful. 

## Conclusion:
Following the data from polling, all potential users are Chico State students, majority of our uses are born in the 1990’s, who frequently shop multiple times a week.  It’s a 50/50 of the limited polling, that use apps and other technology when shopping. There is definitely a point of strain for shoppers when there is lack of stock and missed sales, which this can be a huge opportunity for the app. 
Caveats:
Based on the data, we are only really limiting to Chico state students. This isn’t bad in itself, but Chico has a much more diverse population than just students, further poling would need to be done in the future if this application were to go into production.  
Another point we see is that students mainly shop by proximity, so our app may have limited use and benefit, on the same token though, users may use the app to see if their local store has an item in stock and also may alert the user if a certain sale is occurring.  

## Personas:
	James: Business major
James is a Business administration major in his 20’s, who frequency shops multiple times a week. He has a busy schedule who often looks for cheap meals after he is done with class. He goes to many social events during the weekends and often looks for the best deal on certain beverages for these social events. He has a car, so he often carpools with other students to class. He works out multiple times week and often buys a certain protein drink from a select few places.


	Elizabeth: Engineering
Elizabeth is a mechanical engineer student in her 20’s. She rides her bike to class and has a crazy work load. Shopping is the least of her worries since she as a crazy schedule. When she shops, she goes to the store closes to her apartment and grabs what she likes. On her free time she likes to sit at her computer and play a variety of video games, and enjoy her favorite brand of soda, in which she gets after class on Fridays. 


Note: I derived from our information that our users are in their 20’s and are currently a Chico state student. Mostly they shop from proximity and specialized places. Around half uses app and other technology when shopping, while others do not use anything. 


## Scenario 1: 
It is a Friday and James just got out of class, he and his other frat members have a social event today. He and his friends hop into his car to get the beverages, before he drives off, he pulls out his phone and uses the Grocery Pals app to find the best deal on the said “beverages”. After finding the best deals, they drive over to the store and purchase the product.

## Scenario 2:
after class, Elizabeth found she has some free time. She’s thinking that she is getting low on her stockpile of soda, so she figures she should pick some more up after class. Before she heads home on her bike, she pulls up the Grocery pals app on her phone. She types in the brand of soda she usually buys and finds out that the soda usually goes on sale tomorrow. So instead of purchases the soda today, she decides to wait till tomorrow to purchase the drink.
