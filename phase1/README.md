# Grocery Pals, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

**Google Survey**

* We Used this method as it made the most sense. Because it deals with cost and user preference instead of imprving an existing expierience, this made the most sense for our project, as we can design and shape or concept based upon user responses.

* The number of responses gathered, n = 20

## Findings

**Google Survey**

* Demographics (Age)

The demographics for our survey was incredibly diverse, which is amazing. The age of our responders ranged from 21 all the way to 79 years old. This, while a large portion is closer to the younger side, accurately represents our user base. This is because while our proposed app can be utilized by anyone, a large portion of the base will be a younger audience, as the older generation simply has less interest in new technology. However, some do, and that as a percentage of our users is accurately represented.

* How often do you go grocery shopping?

Responses to this question was approximately a 50/50 split between "once a month" and "multiple times a week." This distribution is important, as our users are shopping on a regular basis, thus proving that an app as proposed will save a lot of money over time. 

* Would comparing the prices of different grocery stores be beneficial?

The response to this question is the most critical, as it outlines whether or not our concept will be actually useful and used. Thankfully, we were presented with overwhelming "yes" responses, with the exception of three "maybe" responses. This provides significant feedback that our concept will actually be useful.

* Do you often encounter items at the grocery store that are far more expensive than you initially thought?

The response to this question was mixed, evenly distributed across all responses. This truly proves hoow unpredictable grocery shopping can be. 

* Do you use any form of app or online method of making grocery lists? If so, what do you use?

This question had a semi-decent response rate, and gave a feel for what the "competition" looks like. Overall, responses given vary, nd people use apps that are not entirely made for the express purpose of grocery lists, which gives feedback on the barrier of entry into the market.

* Do you find that stores do not have the item you are looking for in stock?

The Strong "yes" response in this question proposes the idea that an "inventory" section of our app miht be helpful and utilized. 

* What factors determine where you do your grocery shopping?

The responses here largely were largely evenly distributed. This shows that many different people and types of people go shopping for different reasons, and chose their store based upon both location, as well as either sales or specialty stock, usually not both. Incorporating both separately into the application will be helpful. 

## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

## Caveats

Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do
