# Grocery Pal

**Introduction:**
In this project we tackle the issue of Grocery store pricing. Across different stores, especially in different areas,
there are a variance in pricing and even stocking of many, if not all items sold in grocery stores. Our solution to this
problem is to create a way for consumers to look at the different prices of items at nearby grocery stores. This will allow them to make a grocery list, and then see the total price of these items at nearby stores, so they may shop at the store which gives them the best overall price for the items they need.

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

**Executive Summary**:

In this phase of the project, we:

* Implemented the methods of data gathering and gathered data with them. The method we chose was a google Survey. This is both logically sound, as well as a result of campus closure and social distancing we are now currently expieriencing.

* Analyzed the user data gathered through the survey to draw logical conclusions about our proposed product.

**Data Gathered:**

* Our data gathered includes all user inputs into the survey, specific data will be linked in the **Supplementary Materials** Section in the Link Below

**Most Important Outcomes**

* All personas are Chico State Students
* With the exception of two responses, nobody currently compares prices at the grocery store
* An overwhelming majority of responses support the ability to compare prices across different stores
